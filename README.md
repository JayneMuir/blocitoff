## Blocitoff
A self-destructing to-do list application built with AngularJS and Firebase

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk - tasks that you want to remember but constantly reprioritize. To solve the problem of to-do list clutter, you will build Blocitoff. Blocitoff is a web application that will manage your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days.

Our hypothesis is that if the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list.
